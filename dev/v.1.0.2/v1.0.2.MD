# TensorflowSUI Library v1.0.2

## Overview

TensorflowSUI is a Sui blockchain implementation of neural network inference. This library enables the creation, manipulation, and execution of neural network models directly on the Sui blockchain.

## Core Components

### tensor.move

The tensor module provides data structures and operations for neural network computations.

**Key Functions:**
- `create_signed_fixed`: Creates a tensor with signed fixed-point values
- `scale_up`: Scales values by powers of 10
- `from_input`: Converts input vectors to tensor format
- `to_input`: Extracts magnitude and sign vectors from a tensor
- `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`: Basic arithmetic operations
- `argmax`: Finds the index of the maximum value (used for classification)
- `debug_print_tensor`: Utility for debugging

### graph.move

The graph module implements neural network graph structures and operations.

**Key Functions:**
- `create_signed_graph`: Creates a new neural network graph
- `DenseSignedFixed`: Adds a dense layer to the graph
- `set_layer_weights_signed_fixed`: Sets weights for a layer
- `apply_dense_signed_fixed`: Performs forward pass through a dense layer
- `apply_dense_signed_fixed_2`: Enhanced version with activation support
- `share_graph`: Makes the graph accessible to other transactions
- `ptb_layer`: Processes a single layer with input
- `ptb_layer_arg_max`: Processes a layer and returns the argmax result

**Partial Computation Support:**
- `create_partial_denses`: Creates partial computation state
- `add_partials_for_all_but_last`: Sets up partial computation for all but the last layer
- `ptb_graph_2_compute_chunk`: Computes a chunk of a layer
- `split_chunk_compute`: Splits computation across chunks
- `split_chunk_finalize`: Finalizes partial computation results

### model.move

The model module demonstrates how to use the graph and tensor modules to create a specific neural network model.

**Key Functions:**
- `create_model_signed_fixed`: Creates a neural network with predefined architecture and weights
- `initialize`: Entry function that creates and shares the model

## Usage Example

The included model.move demonstrates a complete implementation of a neural network with:
- Input dimension: 49
- Hidden layers: 16 and 8 neurons
- Output: 10 classes (likely for digit classification)

## Planned Restructuring

In upcoming versions, we plan to restructure the library into more focused modules:

### Core Modules
- **tensor.move**: Core tensor data structures and basic operations
- **ops.move**: Mathematical operations on tensors
- **graph.move**: Neural network graph structure and traversal
- **layers.move**: Implementation of different neural network layers
- **activation.move**: Activation functions (ReLU, Softmax, etc.)
- **model.move**: High-level model creation and inference

### Utility Modules
- **register.move**: Registration of models and components
- **compute.move**: Handling partial/split computations

This restructuring will make the library more maintainable, easier to understand, and follow standard ML library organization patterns.
